# Sentence Reordering Model

This repository is an implementation of a sentence reordering model. This model receives a set of sentences as input and outputs a list of indexes. Output[i] is the index of Input[i] in the ordered form. An example of Train and Test Data is put inside the <em> <strong> data </strong> </em> folder.
